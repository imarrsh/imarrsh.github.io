# My Portfolio Site

This is a simple web page showcasing a bit about me and some of my recent work!

The setup for this project mirrors much of the project setup from TIY, however I experimented with a few different things, namely [Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com) over npm, [Browser Sync](https://browsersync.io) over Live Server and [Concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) over Parallel Shell, to name a few.
